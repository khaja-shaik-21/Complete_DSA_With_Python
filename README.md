Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) ‚Äì Complete Code Repository
This repository is a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations in Python, organized topic-wise from foundational to advanced concepts. Each topic folder contains well-structured code with clearly commented logic and includes time and space complexity analysis for each operation.

üìö Topics Covered:
Arrays & Strings: Searching, sorting, sliding window, prefix sum, two pointers, etc.

Linked Lists: Singly, doubly, circular, operations, and problems.

Stacks & Queues: Implementation using arrays and linked lists, including variations like circular queue, deque, etc.

Trees: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order), and tree operations.

Graphs: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm, cycle detection, topological sort, and graph representations.

Recursion & Backtracking: Classic recursive problems and constraint-based solutions.

Dynamic Programming: Memoization and tabulation-based problems with optimized space/time.

Greedy Algorithms: Interval scheduling, activity selection, Huffman coding, etc.

Sorting & Searching Algorithms: Bubble, merge, quicksort, binary search, etc.

Other Algorithms: Sliding window, prefix sum, union-find, two pointers, etc.

üîç Highlights:
‚úÖ Clean and modular Python code

‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity included in each file

‚úÖ Beginner to advanced level problems

‚úÖ Ideal for interview prep and competitive programming
